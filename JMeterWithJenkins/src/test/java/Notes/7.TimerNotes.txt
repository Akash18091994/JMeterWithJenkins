Timer - 
Timers are use to pause steps execution for specified period of time.

Constant Time - 
With this timer, pause between each step execution for specified period of time.

Gaussian Random Time - 
In this timer, we have fixed delay time (i.e. Constant Delay Offset) and random time (i.e. Deviation).
Pause between each step will be = Constant Delay Offset + Any number of milliecond between specified Deviation. 

Constant Throughput Timer - 
In this timer, if current execution Throughput count is more than specified 'Target Throughput' numbers then further threads hit will pause untill throughput of current execution becomes lower than lTarget Throughput'.

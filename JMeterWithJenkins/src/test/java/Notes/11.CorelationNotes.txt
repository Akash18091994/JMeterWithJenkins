Correlation - 
Correlation means we are receiving dynamic value from previous API calls and keep them in Variables and pass to further API calls.

For example - Before hitting any API call we generally need Authorisation token.
Hence we first need to hit authorisation API call, grab bearer token using 'Regular Expression Extractor', keep it in Variable and pass this variable to futher API calls.

To get value using 'Regular Expression Extractor' - 
Right click on API call - Post Processor - Regular Expression Extractor.
Set Name, Comments, Apply to, Field to Check, Name of created variable.
To give 'Regular Expression' - Grab common response (having value which we want to grab) - Replace value which we want to grab with (.+?) - Set 'Template' as $1$ - Set 'Match No.' as 1. 
This will grab value and set it in Variable which we set.

To use this variable in futher API calls, simply open that API call and set variable name as ${variableName}.
